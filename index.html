        A blueprint for a renewed, vigorous Western civilisation. It is holy, because it is principled, ordered and good. It is a realm because it is a civilisation-state, an ethno-cultural empire. Realm is also Reich. It is the continuation of the holy roman empire, that was interrupted two centuries ago.
        Considering the holy aspect, an essential religious doctrine is formulated, including prophecy, health, philosophy, astrology. Based on the premise that God and the good exist, the main purpose here is to distill the essence a civilisation must have to embody this religious, upward quality.
        The realm embodies aspects of the empire/reich. It includes into political mechanics and tools, economical etiquette and prophecy. The sacred and the worldy are deeply intertwined.

    <p>
        Bleuprint for a renewed, vigorous Western civilisation. Not a religious movement but a metaphysical one, seeking balance with the supernatural in any endeavor of utmost righteousness.

    <h3>The Realm</h3>
    <p>
        The Realm's crown will be the Citadel. This is where the imperial elite gathers and decides on the new emperor. The greatest decisions are made here, that concern the entire realm.
        The Realm will be divided into three scales of governance: municipal, regional and imperial. Every level has a physical building where decisions are made.

<p>This is a map of the various regions and municipalities of the realm. A strong foundation secures a lasting future. This map will be produced in mapbox with greyscale slightly stylized concise graphics.</p>

    <h3>Agogy</h3>
<p>Youth training. The first tread of the state. All subjects undergo rigorous physical, mental and moral education. At young age you will be considered ripe and adult. Not accomplishing will exclude you. Training will be mostly identical for everyone, with strong emphasis on mental skills, moral discipline and physical prowess. 
Traditions and rites of passage symbolise various life cycle stages with their different options and conditions. 
After Agoghe every individual should have a clear path ahead in different degrees of further development or direct labour force entry.

<p>
In the Holy Realm the state is central functioning organ of the society. It is upheld by the good to forge the good. Every subject has a purpose. The state is as one whole body consisting out of many cooperating parts. Every part has a distinct purpose with distinct challenges. This is a distinctly metaphysical worldview, since every parts existence is justified and purposeful. It is goal of the state to aid in aligning and aiding every part. Nothing in such state happens truely unexpected or unprepared. It is the eternal cosmic dance. 88. 
Disruptive or malfunctioning subjects can be directed to a concentration camp style facilities. These will be the classless people, the fallen ones. Where they can get out of through merit. This is mentally ill, gays, enemies, interracials, criminals etc. This camp is a sort of hell, where individuals suffer to redeem their inner misalignments. (Assuming suffering is the most effective remedy) the goal is remove the malfunctioning part and reintegrate it when it is rehabilitated or remove permanently.
The magical principle is paramount to the state. Possibilities outnumber difficulties. Purposeless cruelty is deemed ignoble, ignorant and evil.

    <h3 class="box title">• 卐 • Philosophy of Life • 卍 •</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The world is good. Suffering is like a knot in a rope.</li>
        <li>Symbols are important. They entertain the spirit. Same for myths & rites.</li>
        <li>The supernatural is the natural unexplained.</li>
        <li>By mastering Alchemy we can build paradise on earth. All part of a sacred dance. ∞</li>
        <li>Humans are born with two mutually exclusive substances: a black substance ‘karma/strength’ and a white substance ‘virtue/brightness’. ~Upbringing determines rigidness or openness. Right-turning upbringing creates water & air, left-turning upbringing creates earth & fire.</li>
        <li>Sacredness exists in quiet, liminal, natural places. They allow ‘grounding’.</li>
        <li>Liminal: dawn & dusk. Water crossways. Old groves & trees. High mountains.</li>
        <li>Games, dance, music, are the greatest healers.</li>
        <li>Cultivate a positive mindset. Tackle problems as they arise.</li>
        <li>Good laws & ethics produce lasting peace, prosperity and happiness.</li>
        <li>Sun worship is the purest highest religion.</li>
        <li>Such cult rejects prophecies or believe. It eternally maintains, renews and rejoices in the present.</li>
        <li>Such cult does not appease the individual, but integrates everything into the Whole, like a wheel around a centered axis. Judging everything according to this relationship. Striving to lead all to the center.</li>
        <li>Such cult understands prayer or release to be essentially valuable for human development. It ensures hygiene, cleanliness, orderliness, silence, green and seeks the optima forma in every human endeavor.</li>
        <li>Free Will means everything can be redeemed. Every constituent of the state should approximate perfection.</li>
        <li>One can achieve Perfection through work & prayer, or Labor et Ora. Work disintegrates the black substance (into the white), prayer integrates the white substance (into gold). Ratio differs by personal constitution.</li>
        <li>The study of alchemy is the study of the inner mechanics of the inner & outer world. (micro & macro cosmos.)</li>
        <li>Act & dress like the person you want to be.</li>
        <li>The challenge of civilisation is to combine enlightenment with rigor, or peace with strength.</li>
        <li>When a civilisation definitively loses order, it will spiral downward to the point where a strongman re-establishes it.</li>
        <li>Civilisation requires constant integration and restoration, as it revolves through the signs of the zodiac.</li>
        <li>The World Order was toppled in the French revolution. All wars since have been attempts to restore it. Since then there has been steady decay, because we started denying the principles of nature. This situation will inevitably lead to an entire new world order from the ashes.</li>
        <li>Gods sometime incarnate. But diligence is due. They can shrivel your society or lift it to the skies.</li>
        <li>God can be revived, race not.</li>
        <li>Truth requires little explanation. Beware of overly verbose doctrine, truth is revealed in brevity.</li>
        <li>Truth does not fear investigation.</li>
        <li>Heroism upholds values. Passivity is a slow killer.</li>
        <li>If you’re waiting you can also stop waiting. Everything has it’s counterpart like this. Seek balance in everything.</li>
        <li>A people not convinced of its uniqueness or value will perish.</li>
        <li>Fundamentally we should strive to live in balance with nature. Ideally problems are solved through cleverness than through violence.</li>
        <li>You are infinitesimally small yet undeniably valuable.</li>
        <li>The mind is less powerful than we think, a civilisation that has no metaphysics, world view or mind training is a truely perverse one.</li>
        <li>The community and state should be the fallback for when the family fails the individual.</li>
        <li>God does not care how much you suffer nor is he sympathetic.</li>
        <li>Time is entropic. Human endeavour is necessary for regeneration. This is the meaning of the 卐. Also it depicts the zodiac revolving around the sun.</li>
        <li>Humans are imperfect and need moulding. Friction is a heat producer. A society afraid of interaction will atrophy, and turn primitive and dull.</li>
        <li>Gods can become demons. Demons can become gods. Everything emanates from the One.</li>
    </ol>
