    <h2>
        This is The Holy Realm.
    </h2>
    <p>
        A blueprint for a renewed, vigorous Western civilisation. It is holy, because it is principled, ordered and good. It is a realm because it is a civilisation-state, an ethno-cultural empire. Realm is also Reich. It is the continuation of the holy roman empire, that was interrupted two centuries ago.
        Considering the holy aspect, an essential religious doctrine is formulated, including prophecy, health, philosophy, astrology. Based on the premise that God and the good exist, the main purpose here is to distill the essence a civilisation must have to embody this religious, upward quality.
        The realm embodies aspects of the empire/reich. It includes into political mechanics and tools, economical etiquette and prophecy. The sacred and the worldy are deeply intertwined.

    <h3>Citadel</h3>
    <p>
        We build a Capital of Europe on an ancient pagan site. This is where the imperial elite gathers and decides on the new emperor. The greatest decisions are made here, that concern the entire realm.
